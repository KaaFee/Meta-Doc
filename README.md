# MetaDoc
"Meta Doc" is a project developed using 3-tier architecture of the .NET Framework. The primary objective of this project is to facilitate seamless communication and assistance between patients and doctors. 

The project encompasses three layers: the presentation layer, business logic layer, and data access layer. Each layer plays a crucial role in ensuring the smooth functioning of the application.

In the presentation layer, an intuitive and user-friendly interface is designed to allow patients to easily navigate through various features and functionalities. Patients can register, create profiles, and securely log in to access personalized medical services. They can also search for doctors based on specialization, location, and availability, and book appointments conveniently.

The business logic layer acts as the brain of the application, handling all the essential operations and processing the requests from the presentation layer. It incorporates complex algorithms and business rules to match patients with suitable doctors based on their requirements. Additionally, it manages appointment scheduling, sends notifications and reminders, and maintains the overall functionality of the system.

The data access layer handles the interaction with the underlying database, ensuring efficient storage and retrieval of patient and doctor information. It stores details such as patient profiles, doctor profiles, appointment records, medical history, and other relevant data in a secure and organized manner.

"Meta Doc" aims to streamline the healthcare experience for both patients and doctors. Patients can easily find suitable healthcare providers, schedule appointments, access medical records, and receive personalized care. On the other hand, doctors can manage their schedules effectively, view patient information, provide online consultations, and maintain a comprehensive record of their practice.
